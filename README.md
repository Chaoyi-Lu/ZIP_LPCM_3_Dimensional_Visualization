This GitHub repository is a complementary material for the paper **"A Zero-Inflated Latent Position Cluster Model" (ZIP-LPCM)** to provide the 3-dimensional interactive visualization of the synthetic networks and the real networks therein. 
The paper mainly works on the ZIP-LPCM incorporated with the **mixture-of-finite-mixtures (MFM)** clustering prior.
The inference is based on a novel **partially collapsed Metropolis-within-Gibbs (PCMwG)** sampler with a newly proposed **truncated absorb-eject (TAE)** move embedded inside.
A supervised version of the method is also provided.
One key aspect of the paper is that we illustrate our results on 3-dimensional latent spaces.
We refer to the paper for more details, and we refer to another repository: [https://github.com/Chaoyi-Lu/ZIP-LPCM](https://github.com/Chaoyi-Lu/ZIP-LPCM) for the details of the coding and implementations.
